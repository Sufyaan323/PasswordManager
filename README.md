# PasswordManager
A Python project which uses SQLite to create and store usernames and passwords, as well as the website name.

---
Research Needed:
1. How does a password manager works?
2. How does hashing work?
3. Is there any extensions I need to use to allow Python to interact with the SQLlite database?
---
Research Results:
1. There are 3 main types of password managers:
    1. Offline - The passwords are stored locally
    2. Online - The passwords are stored on a remote server
    3. Token-based / Stateless - A physical hardware, such as a USB, which contains a key to unlock a user's account

    <p>I will be creating an <b>offline password manager</b> which will first hash and maybe even salt passwords before inputting them into the SQL database i will create with SQLite, a serverless database.</p>
